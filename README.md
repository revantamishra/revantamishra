<p align="center">
  Research-driven design of <strong>formal control, verification, and execution constraints</strong> for AI systems.<br/>
  Focused on system-level mechanisms that define and enforce behavioral boundaries across intelligent agents.

## Status

- Research-oriented development  
- Actively iterating on control abstractions and enforcement mechanisms  
- Public work reflects exploratory and foundational systems research

## Research Interests

- **AI Control & Safety** — system-level mechanisms for constraining model behavior  
- **Execution Control** — pre-execution authorization and runtime enforcement  
- **Formal Verification** — correctness, safety, and auditability of AI actions  
- **Agent Architectures** — control surfaces across models, tools, and environments  
- **Governance by Design** — embedding policy and constraints into execution layers

## Philosophy

I do not build isolated “controllable AI systems.”  
I build the **control layer** that governs *any* AI system—across models, architectures, and execution environments.
